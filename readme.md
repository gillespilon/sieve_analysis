# Sieve analysis

## In brevi

The purpose of this Jupyter notebook is to perform a sieve analysis.

## Data

Download the data file:

- [sieve_data.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QuhQmVAnxEakP879FnAt-GD0ElpuT49M)

This file has five columns:

- std sieve
- tyler sieve
- sieve diameter
- sieve mass
- sieve soil mass

Clear the contents of the "sieve mass" and "sieve soil mass" columns. Enter values of "sieve mass" and "sieve soil mass" for the desired sieves. Save the file as a CSV with UTF-8 encoding.

## Methodology

A sieve analysis is used to determine the particle size distribution of a granular material. Material is passed through a series of progressively smaller sieves. The mass of the material stopped by each sieve is determined as a fraction of the whole mass.
