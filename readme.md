# Sieve analysis

## In brevi

The purpose of this script is to perform a sieve analysis.

## Methodology

A sieve analysis is used to determine the particle size distribution of a granular material. Material is passed through a series of progressively smaller sieves. The mass of the material stopped by each sieve is determined as a fraction of the whole mass.
